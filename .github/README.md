## About

SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool. SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. You can [search for database schema objects](https://www.schemacrawler.com/schemacrawler-grep.html) using regular expressions, and output the schema and data in a readable text format.

This is a bare project that acts as an MCP client for the [SchemaCrawler AI MCP Server](https://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-AI) for use in "Agent" mode. You can find documentation on how to use the server here.

The SchemaCrawler AI MCP Server is available on [the Docker MCP Catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp/server/schemacrawler-ai/overview) as a Docker-verified image.
